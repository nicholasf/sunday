Sunday

An itch I have to scratch. An experiment. Inspired by the conflicting impulses of creativity and laziness when contemplating writing software on a Sunday afternoon.

Also inspired by the following blogpost about MVC: http://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/

WIP.

- [ ] Configurable session store (some complexity). In progress
- [ ] Param conversion on the Sunday request
- [ ] Static files (configurable, also able to turn them off)
- [ ] Consider model concept further
- [ ] Consider response headers
